  together, allowing transparent writing to a given path in the face
  of file closing / moving.

  Supports the logging of data to files which will be rotated by
  another system process.

  *NOTE*: As currently coded, this is geared specifically toward the
  needs of Probe (e.g., files are opened in `append` mode, writing
  UTF8, etc.) and no attempt is made to create a complete and
  general-purpose tool.

  Constructor function.

  When given a file path, a new `#{inspect __MODULE__}` instance is
  created.

  When given a `#{inspect __MODULE__}` instance, if the underlying
  file is determined to have changed (the current inode associated
  with the path does not match the inode of the instance) the open
  file descriptor of the instance is closed and a "fresh" instance is
  returned, with a new open file descriptor.

  (Note that, depending on the environment, it is possible that the
  same inode will get reused between an "old" `#{inspect __MODULE__}`
  and one that has been "refreshed" in this way; we have observed this
  in Docker, for instance. This can happen if the underlying file has
  been deleted, and the `#{inspect __MODULE__}` re-creates it in the
  process of being refreshed. In such a situation, however, the file
  descriptor that is opened will be different.)

  Always opens files with the modes `#{inspect @file_modes}`. See
  `File.open/2` for details.
